# Food-101

## About

The Food-101 dataset is a popular dataset used for image classification tasks intended for training and evaluating machine learning models in food recognition. It contains a total of 101 different food categories containing 1000 images, 750 for training and 250 for testing, totalling 101,000 high-resolution images. Each category or label represents a wide range of food from more common dishes to more exotic with different presentations, angles, lighting, backgrounds, and portion sizes. For our project, we have decided to manually split and upload the training dataset into varying batches varying in increments of 10% of the data, equally distributed under each label, until it reaches 100% of the training set, 75,750 images.
